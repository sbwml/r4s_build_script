+	  This option turns the kernel into a real-time kernel by replacing
+	  various locking primitives (spinlocks, rwlocks, etc.) with
+	  preemptible priority-inheritance aware variants, enforcing
+	  interrupt threading and introducing mechanisms to break up long
+	  non-preemptible sections. This makes the kernel, except for very
+	  low level and critical code paths (entry code, scheduler, low
+	  level interrupt handling) fully preemptible and brings most
+	  execution contexts under scheduler control.
